          <p class="view" style="font-size: 17.5px;" > <b>Can We Be Strangers Again? by Shrijeet Shandilya is a heartfelt contemporary romance that explores the emotional journey of two individuals who fall deeply in love but slowly drift apart due to misunderstandings, ego clashes, and changing life priorities. The story captures the beauty of young love—filled with excitement, dreams, late-night conversations, and promises of forever. However, as time passes, reality begins to test their bond. Small arguments grow into painful silences, and unspoken feelings create distance between them.
                The novel highlights how love is not always enough to sustain a relationship without communication, trust, and mutual understanding. Through emotional moments and reflective thoughts, the characters struggle with memories of their past while trying to accept their present. The pain of separation forces them to question whether it is possible to forget someone who once meant everything.
            The book beautifully portrays heartbreak, healing, and personal growth. It emphasizes that sometimes letting go is a part of loving, and moving forward requires strength. Ultimately, the story leaves readers with a touching question: can two people who once shared their whole world truly become strangers again, or do memories always keep them connected?</b></p>
